# Thermal
Thermal Emulator (esc/pos) built in Rust.

This is a work in progress and should not in any way be used right now.

This is my first Rust project, so things will be very messy. Feedback and contribution is welcome.

Goal is to have a functional esc/pos emulator that has a state that is written to a file for onboard images and whatnot that can render to.

* json debug file
* image file
* html file
